# Horiseon Marketing: Code Refactor Project

Take the code provided and refactor the code using semantic HTML elements for accessibility; verify all links work; code is concise; and is SEO-optimized to create an optimal user experience

## Motivation
My motivation for refracturing the code was to get comfortable with reading code; implementing semantic HTML elements, and figuring out how the code could be improved upon. 

During this project I learned, how to solve the issue of divergent branches; how adding semantics makes it easier to understand the structure of a webpage; and how descriptive classes and IDs can help a future developer decipher what is what.

## Description

This project solves four problems: 

  * It follows accessibility guidelines to give an optimal user experience for everyone who visits the site. 

  * Makes the code easy to read

  * Makes concise and descriptive code to assist future developers who may work on the site to make changes easily
  
  *  Making the site accessible allows the company to rank higher on SEO. Which in turn, can lead to more traffic on their website and increased revenue. 

# Changes Made

* Replaced div elements with semantic elements to make the code easier to read and understand

* Organzied the page elements to follow a logical structure

* Added alt attributes to assist those with screen readers better

* All headings follow a sequential sequence 

* Updated title page to better optimize search results

* Concised the CSS code to eliminate extra lines of code
